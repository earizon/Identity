# FIDO2 "Passwordless" Standard
* <https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/>

# industry’s answer to the password problem
    The FIDO Alliance developed FIDO Authentication standards based on
  public key cryptography for authentication that is more secure than
  passwords and SMS OTPs, simpler for consumers to use, and easier for
  service providers to deploy and manage.
# FIDO Authentication enables password-only logins to be replaced with
  secure and fast login experiences across websites and apps.
    Enabling a fundamental shift to phishing-resistant authentication

  ```
  LEGACY, KNOWLEDGE-BASED      MODERN, POSSESSION-BASED
  CREDENTIALING                CREDENTIALING:
  =======================      ========================
  - Stored on a server         - On-device (never on a server)
  - SMS OTP                    - Local Biometric / PIN
  - KBA                        - DocAuth
  - Passwords                  - Multi-device FIDO credentials
  ```

FIDO2: enables users to leverage common devices to easily 
authenticate to online services in both mobile and desktop 
environments.

## Standards followed:
* W3C Web Authentication (WebAuthn) specification
* FIDO Alliance’s corresponding Client-to-Authenticator Protocol (CTAP).

## Benefits:
* Security: cryptographic login credentials are unique across every website,
            never leave the user’s device and are never stored on a server.
            ELIMINATING THE RISKS OF PHISHING, ALL FORMS OF PASSWORD THEFT AND REPLAY ATTACKS.
* Convenience: unlock cryptographic login credentials with simple built*in methods such as
            fingerprint readers or cameras on their devices, or by leveraging easy*to*use
            FIDO security keys.
* Cross*device: (MObile, web, IoT, ...)
* Privacy: Because FIDO cryptographic keys are unique for each internet site, they cannot
           be used to track users across sites. Plus, biometric data, when used, never leaves
           the user’s device.
* Scalability: Websites can enable FIDO2 through a simple JavaScript API call that is supported  [[{scalability]]
           across leading browsers and platforms on billions of devices consumers use every day. [[}]]
