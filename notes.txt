# Hidden cost of broken Identity 

[[{doc_has.report]]

* The 2017 Hiscox Cyber Readiness Reportestimates that cybercrime and
  data breaches currently cost the global economy US $450 billion per
  year.
* The 2016 Cybersecurity Market Reportpredicts cybercrime damages
  will cost the global economy a total of US $6 trillion by 2021.
* The U.S. Public Interest Research Group estimatesconsumers will
  have to directly shell out a collective US $4.1 billion to freeze
  their credit reports and prevent fraudsters from using personal
  information possibly exposed in the massive data breach at Equifax.11
* IDG estimates that theft of trade secretscosts every nation from 1
  TO 3 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP), for a total
  ranging from US $749 billion to $2.2 trillion annually.

* Kim Cameron, Chief Architect of Identity at Microsoft, famously said
  in the preface to his Seven Laws of Identity, “The Internet was
  built without an identity layer.” In other words, we are
  backfilling for identity and security on a network where in the early
  days “everybody knew everybody” and trust was so implicit that
  routing tables for IP addresses were coded by hand. By contrast the
  ten current Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standards for DNS
  security alone run to over 500 pages.
