## SAML Federated Identity
* SAML stands for Security Assertion Markup Language, based on XML protocol
* Use cases:
  * Web Single Sign-On
  * Identity Federation
  * WS-Security
* Federated identity model is founded on open standards adoption.
* SAML compares to OAuth/OpenID
* SAML defines resource access based on the identity of user/device/service
* Standard data format for exchangin authentication and authorization data
  between trusting parties
* Usually between an identity providers and a service provider.
* Individual COmpanies manage their own user identity stores, but share an
  amount of required security verification data via a SAML token
* SAML 2 is Flexible and extensible, it is designed to be used by other standards.
  * SAML 1.0
  * SAML 1.1
  * SAML 2.0

* It is beeing "replaced" (Not actually) by OAuth/OpenID when scaling Identity Providers
  and federated identities from Companies Networks to the Internet Network,
  where Google, Facebook... become the "super-identity providers".

* SAML 2.0 Benefits:
  * Platform neutral
  * Increased security
  * Commercial and open source support

* SAML 2.0 profiles:
  * Single Sign-On
  * Single Sign-Out
* Profiles define how SAML is used in the identity provider service.
  (Assertions, protocols, bindings)

* SAML protocol requires information to be exchanged between identity provider (eg.Azure AD)
  and the service provider (the application).
  * Azure AD    == asserting (issuing) party
  * Application == relying (verifier) party

* TRUST SETUP:

  ¹: Trust relationship setup is done by App developer with initial access to identity
     provider by registering the |Service Provider| required info in the IdP. In
     particular registering:
     * Redirect URI
     * Metadata URI used by IdP to retrieve the signing key and loguout URI of (cloud) service
