## RFC 9449: Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession (DPoP)
* https://oauth.net/2/dpop/
* https://darutk.medium.com/illustrated-dpop-oauth-access-token-security-enhancement-801680d761ff 
* datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9449
RFC 9449: OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession at the Application Layer (DPoP) 
 DPoP, or Demonstrating Proof of Possession, is an extension that 
describes a technique to cryptographically bind access tokens to a 
particular client when they are issued. This is one of many attempts 
at improving the security of Bearer Tokens by requiring the 
application using the token to prove possession of the same private 
key that was used to obtain the token.

## RFC 7636 : Proof Key for Code Exchange (
https://www.authlete.com/developers/pkce/
RFC 7636 : Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE, pronounced “pixy”) is a specification about a countermeasure against the authorization code interception attack. The specification was released on September, 2015. It has added:code_challenge parameter and code_challenge_method parameter to authorization requests using the authorization code flow, andcode_verifier parameter to token requests that correspond to the authorization requests.This mechanism enables an authorization server to reject a token request from a malicious application that does not have a code verifier.

## supabase react native Oauth login in Android anf iOS
https://supabase.com/blog/native-mobile-auth 
Supabase supports OAuth logins with 17 providers including Apple, 
Google, Microsoft, GitHub, ... But for native mobile apps, this meant 
that developers had to use a web browser to sign in. It’s not an 
ideal flow for users, who are already used to signing in with the 
operating system’s native dialogs when possible. Today, we are 
excited to announce full native support for Sign in with Apple and 
Google on iOS and Android. But this is not all! Supabase Auth now can 
now be used with one-tap sign in methods like: Sign in with Apple JS, 
Sign in with Google for Web or even in Chrome extensions.Native Sign 
in with Apple and GoogleDevelopers of native iOS and Android apps 
(using Flutter or React Native) can now take advantage of OS-provided 
authentication dialogs for Apple and Google. This is available on 
iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS apps in the Apple ecosystem, and all 
Android variants in the Google ecosystem

## (Community-driven) User Controlled Authorization Network (UCAN) STANDARD.  [[{]]
* <https://ucan.xyz/>
* extension of JSON Web Token (JWT) specifically designed to enable ways of
  authorizing offline-first apps and distributed systems.
* UCANs are all you need to sign into multiple machines, delegate access for 
  service providers to do things while you are offline, securely collaborate
  on documents with a team, and more. 
* fine or coarse-grained control, all controlled by the one who cares about
  the data the most: the user.
* No central "all-powerful" authorization server. Everything that a user is
  allowed to do is captured directly in a key or self-contained token, and
  can be sent to anyone that knows how to interpret this format.
* KEY-POINT: all accounts are equipped with a global ID and cryptographic keys,
  we were able to design a system that has very few assumptions and thus works
  in a huge number of situations.
* Setup has several advantages:
  * Low effort: developers don’t need to write and maintain complex access logic.

*  Himeji stores permissions data and performs
  permission checks as a central source of truth. It uses a sharded and
  replicated in-memory cache to improve performance and lower latencies
  and has served checks in production for about a year. Its throughput
  has scaled up from 0 in March 2020 to 850k entities/sec in March 2021
  while maintaining 99.999% availability and 12-millisecond latency at
  the 99 percentile.

## GoTrue OAuth [[{use_case.AAA,protocol.oauth,standards.jwt,01_PM.low_code,01_PM.TODO]]
<https://github.com/netlify/gotrue>

- lightweight open-source and self-standing API for handling
  user registration (signup) and authentication and custom user data.
- based on OAuth2 and JWT.

- Configuration through ".env" config file or
  environment variables (GOTRUE_*)

  Config. include options to set (request) rate limits,
  multi-instance (multi-tenant?), DB backend (mysql only as 2021-06),
  logging, tracing, JWT and other cryptographic secrets,
  WEBHOOK_URL (called upon validate/signup/login events),
  WEBHOOK_RETRIES,...

  JWT tokens can also be managed by:
  - Audience (group of users)
  - admin groups

- External Authentication supported for:
  ✓ bitbucket ✓ gitlab
  ✓ github    ✓ google

  Example github external config:
  GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=my_app_client_id
  GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GITHUB_SECRET=client_secret_values_sssh

- Support for password recovery through email.
  SMTP config summary:
  GOTRUE_SMTP_HOST=smtp.mandrillapp.com
  GOTRUE_SMTP_USER=smtp-delivery@example.com
  GOTRUE_SMTP_PASS=...
  GOTRUE_SMTP_MAX_FREQUENCY=...  min secs to wait before re-sending
                                 signup confirm/pass reset
  (+ e-mail template file)

- Exposed REST-API endpoints:
  GET /settings:
  POST /signup  (email + password)
  POST /invite  (email)
  POST /verify  (type:=singup|recovery, token, ...)
                returns access_token + refresh_token
  POST /recover (email)
  POST /token   (OAuth2 endpoint implementing pass/refresh_token/
                 and authorization_code grant types)
  PUT /user     (Update a user).
  POST /logout  (revoke all refresh tokens for user).
         WARN : JWT tokens will still be valid for stateless auth
                until expiration (1hour by default)

- Alternatives to Gotrue (in some contexts) can be:
  1. Keycloak, very complete but "heavy" (Java based) Identity solution.
     Actually gotrue can be seen service provider (SP) connected to Keycloak:
     → keycloak admin console
       → create client:
         ID "https://example.com/.netlify/identity/saml" ← gotrue API endpoint

We are using EnvoyFilter to enable SAML2 authentication with 
Oauth2Proxy and Dex, looking to redirect the calls coming through the 
istio-ingressgatey to be check by Oauth2Proxy if the SAML2 
authentication was establish,

 if not redirect to Dex to start the SAML2 authentication process

## OIDC Standard Claims
https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims

5.1.  Standard Claims

This specification defines a set of standard Claims. They can be requested to be returned either in the UserInfo Response, per Section 5.3.2, or in the ID Token, per Section 2.


MemberTypeDescription
sub string Subject - Identifier for the End-User at the Issuer.

name string End-User's full name in displayable form including all name parts, possibly including titles and suffixes, ordered according to the End-User's locale and preferences.

given_name string Given name(s) or first name(s) of the End-User. Note that in some cultures, people can have multiple given names; all can be present, with the names being separated by space characters.

family_name string Surname(s) or last name(s) of the End-User. Note that in some cultures, people can have multiple family names or no family name; all can be present, with the names being separated by space characters.

middle_name string Middle name(s) of the End-User. Note that in some cultures, people can have multiple middle names; all can be present, with the names being separated by space characters. Also note that in some cultures, middle names are not used.

nickname string Casual name of the End-User that may or may not be the same as the given_name. For instance, a nickname value of Mike might be returned alongside a given_name value of Michael.

preferred_username string Shorthand name by which the End-User wishes to be referred to at the RP, such as janedoe or j.doe. This value MAY be any valid JSON string including special characters such as @, /, or whitespace. The RP MUST NOT rely upon this value being unique, as discussed in Section 5.7.

profile string URL of the End-User's profile page. The contents of this Web page SHOULD be about the End-User.

picture string URL of the End-User's profile picture. This URL MUST refer to an image file (for example, a PNG, JPEG, or GIF image file), rather than to a Web page containing an image. Note that this URL SHOULD specifically reference a profile photo of the End-User suitable for displaying when describing the End-User, rather than an arbitrary photo taken by the End-User.


website string URL of the End-User's Web page or blog. This Web page SHOULD contain information published by the End-User or an organization that the End-User is affiliated with.

email string End-User's preferred e-mail address. Its value MUST conform to the RFC 5322 [RFC5322] addr-spec syntax. The RP MUST NOT rely upon this value being unique, as discussed in Section 5.7.

email_verified boolean True if the End-User's e-mail address has been verified; otherwise false. When this Claim Value is true, this means that the OP took affirmative steps to ensure that this e-mail address was controlled by the End-User at the time the verification was performed. The means by which an e-mail address is verified is context-specific, and dependent upon the trust framework or contractual agreements within which the parties are operating.

gender string End-User's gender. Values defined by this specification are female and male. Other values MAY be used when neither of the defined values are applicable.

birthdate string End-User's birthday, represented as an ISO 8601:2004 [ISO8601‑2004] YYYY-MM-DD format. The year MAY be 0000, indicating that it is omitted. To represent only the year, YYYY format is allowed. Note that depending on the underlying platform's date related function, providing just year can result in varying month and day, so the implementers need to take this factor into account to correctly process the dates.

zoneinfo string: String from zoneinfo [zoneinfo] time zone database representing the End-User's time zone. For example, Europe/Paris or America/Los_Angeles.
locale string End-User's locale, represented as a BCP47 [RFC5646] language tag. This is typically an ISO 639-1 Alpha-2 [ISO639‑1] language code in lowercase and an ISO 3166-1

Alpha-2 [ISO3166‑1] country code in uppercase, separated by
a dash. For example, en-US or fr-CA. As a compatibility note, some implementations have used an underscore as the separator rather than a dash, for example, en_US; Relying Parties MAY choose to accept this locale syntax as well.

phone_number string End-User's preferred telephone number. E.164 [E.164] is RECOMMENDED as the format of this Claim, for example, +1 (425) 555-1212 or +56 (2) 687 2400. If the phone number contains an extension, it is RECOMMENDED that the extension be represented using the RFC 3966 [RFC3966] extension syntax, for example, +1 (604) 555-1234;ext=5678.

phone_number_verified boolean True if the End-User's phone number has been verified; otherwise false. When this Claim Value is true, this means that the OP took affirmative steps to ensure that this phone number was controlled by the End-User at the time the verification was performed. The means by which a phone number is verified is context-specific, and dependent upon the trust framework or contractual agreements within which the parties are operating. When true, the phone_number Claim MUST be in E.164 format and any extensions MUST be represented in RFC 3966 format.

address JSON object End-User's preferred postal address. The value of the address member is a JSON [RFC4627] structure containing some or all of the members defined in Section 5.1.1.

updated_at number Time the End-User's information was last updated. Its value is a JSON number representing the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z as measured in UTC until the date/time.

## rfc6750 bearer token

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750 bearer token

1. Authorization: bearer xxxxx

2.FORM URL ENCO: acess_token

If the protected resource request included an access token and failed
   authentication, the resource server SHOULD include the "error"
   attribute to provide the client with the reason why the access
   request was declined.  The parameter value is described in
   Section 3.1.  In addition, the resource server MAY include the
   "error_description" attribute to provide developers a human-readable
   explanation that is not meant to be displayed to end-users.  It also
   MAY include the "error_uri" attribute with an absolute URI
   identifying a human-readable web page explaining the error.  The
   "error", "error_description", and "error_uri" attributes MUST NOT
   appear more than once.

   Values for the "scope" attribute (specified in Appendix A.4 of
   [RFC6749]) MUST NOT include characters outside the set %x21 / %x23-5B
   / %x5D-7E for representing scope values and %x20 for delimiters
   between scope values.  Values for the "error" and "error_description"
   attributes (specified in Appendixes A.7 and A.8 of [RFC6749]) MUST
   NOT include characters outside the set %x20-21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-7E.
   Values for the "error_uri" attribute (specified in Appendix A.9 of
   [RFC6749]) MUST conform to the URI-reference syntax and thus MUST NOT
   include characters outside the set %x21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-7E.

   For example, in response to a protected resource request without
   authentication:

     HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
     WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="example"
