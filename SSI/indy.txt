# Indy Privacy by default [[{dev_stack.indy,privacy,TODO]]

Hyperledger Indy "Privacy by Design" for decentralized identity management

 Business Insider recently published a report citing a Facebook
breach enabled attackers to use compromised Facebook credentials
to access other services like Tinder, Spotify and Airbnb.

Hyperledger Indy is being built to address current issues:
 - A lack of transparency in how data is being used.
 - Preventing the "over-sharing" of data by providing only
   the minimal data attributes to a service provider.
 - A single "centralized" point of breach may have cascading consequences.
   If a user's credentials have been used to sign up for
   other online services, those services can also be accessed
   using these credentials.

Avoiding data leakage is a key scenario that Hyperledger is trying to address.
 """Hyperledger Indy allows you to construct interactions where the degree
 of disclosure is explicit and minimal, much smaller than what was previously
 possible. Nothing about the mechanics of connecting, talking, or proving in
 Indy is leaky with respect to privacy; vulnerabilities that emerge must
 come from the broader context. No other technology takes this minimization
 as far as Indy does, and no other technology separates interactions from one
 another as carefully. If privacy problems are like a biohazard, Indy is
 the world's most vocal champion of wearing gloves and using a sharps
 container for needles  and it provides the world's best latex and disinfectants."""

- Indy uses Decentralized Identities (DIDs). DIDs are under the control
 of the user that owns it and is independent from a centralized provider
 or authority. By using DIDs, Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) solutions can
 be developed so that a person or business can store their identity and
 provide relevant data to service providers who can validate it using claims
 at the time of using the service.

-*DIDs are pairwise unique and pseudonymous by default to prevent
 ºcorrelationº. Phillip J. Windley, chair of Sovrin Foundation, explains
  why this is important:
  - Indy is all about giving identity owners independent control of their
  personal data and relationships. Indy is built so that the owner of the
  identity is structurally part of transactions made about that identity.
  - Pairwise identifiers not only prevent correlation, but they stop third
  parties from transacting without the identity owner taking part since the
  identity owner is the only place pairwise identifiers can be correlated.

- While DIDs seems like a step in the right direction for end-user
privacy, there are ways in which organizations may try to defeat the
protection that Indy is providing. Hardman explains:

- If we use pairwise DIDs and zero-knowledge proofs, the message is
  clearly "don\u2019t try to correlate me", even if you could find a
  way to do it if you try hard enough. An HTTP Do-Not-Track header says
  "do not track me", but it doesn\u2019t offer any actual protection
  from tracking. The VRM community has been talking about user-defined
  terms for a long time. In a relationship, you can express "don\u2019t
  use my data for advertising" or "delete my data after 14 days" or
  "use my data for research, but not commercially".

- Hardman feels that expressing these intentions in code and
architecture does have value by itself and is optimistic about its
effectiveness moving forward:

- Over time, we expect that through regulation, trust frameworks,
 reputation, and similar mechanisms, not honoring such intentions will
 be discouraged. Of course we must always communicate clearly the
 limits of intentions and guarantees, lest we create a false sense of
 security that can lead to severe consequences.

- Hyperledger does provide incentives for transforming privacy.
 Currently, storing Personal Identifiable Information (PII) creates
 risk for both consumers and corporations. However, by storing an
 opaque identifier for a customer and then making requests to a
 customer\u2019s agent to obtain more information on-demand and
 discard after its use is a step in the right direction for consumers
 and de-risks broadscale data breaches.

# Verifiable Organizations Network (Canada Gov) [[{dev_stack.indy]]
The Verifiable Organizations Network (VON) is a community effort to
establish a better way to find, issue, store and share trustworthy
data about organizations—locally and around the globe. Community
partners are using jointly developed software components to enable
the digitization of government-issued public
credentials—registrations, permits, and licenses. Currently, VON
components are based on Hyperledger Indy distributed ledger
technology. VON helps by making:
- applying for credentials faster and less error prone
- issuing (and reissuing) credentials simpler and more secure, and
- verifying credentials more standard, trustworthy, and transparent, anywhere in the world.

- The first production services, OrgBook BC, and Ontario's Verifiable
  Businesses are publicly accessible, open-source, and show what future
  business permits and licenses could look like.

# Indy Use Case Example  [[{dev_stack.Indy,TODO]]
<https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain-Identity/indy-ssivc-tutorial>
The Indy World Demo implements the Alice Demo described in Getting
Started with Indy. The demo shows how a self-sovereign identity
("SSI") can be used to obtain credentials from an issuer and supply
these credentials to a verifier in response to a proof request thus
providing a verifiable proof.

As part of an initiative to manage Verifiable Organizations with
Self-Sovereign Identities, the Government for the Province of British
Columbia ("BC-Gov") in partnership with Public Services and
Procurement Canada and the Government of Ontario, has contributed
several open-source projects that are helpful in bootstrapping new
applications that make use of Hyperledger Indy ("Indy") and
Verifiable Credentials. This Indy World Demo is derived from the
permitify and von-network repositories.

- Hyperledger Indy Catalyst is a set of application level software
  components designed to accelerate the adoption of trustworthy entity
  to entity1 communications based on Decentralized Identity /
  Self-Sovereign Identity technology and architecture. Indy Catalyst is
  builds upon globally available open standards and open source
  software. At present, Indy Catalyst builds upon Hyperledger Indy,
  common enterprise open source software, frameworks and patterns such
  as PostgreSQL, Python, Angular and RESTful APIs. Efforts will be
  taken to design the software to facilitate the incorporation of
  evolving open standards and technology. The impetus for Indy Catalyst
  came from the Verifiable Organizations Network (VON) project. More
  information about VON can be found at vonx.io
