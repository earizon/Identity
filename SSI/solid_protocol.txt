# Solid (decentrilized) Protocol 
<https://solidproject.org/for-developers/>
* Standard proposed by Teem Berners Lee (Web inventor).
* Solid is an extension (vs replacement) of current Webs,
  working on any modern browser.
* The objective is to centralize all "scattered data" around
  on the Internet like Social Networks, Online-Shops (Amazon,...),
  digital services  (online banks, ...) and keep that data under
  the control on final users (vs Facebook, Google, Amazon,...).
  User's "Pods" are in charge of storing all our personal data:
  Pods can be self-hosted or provided by Pod's service provider.
* Compares to W3C DID/VC. WebID is the equivalent to W3C DID.    [comparative]
  As with DIDs, different WebID's can be owned by the same person,
  e.g., one WebID issued by governments, another self-issued WebID for
  personal uses, ...
* "Vocabularies" help to interpret Pod's data to any independent
  service/application/company that has been granted access.
* Helps to build application decoupled from data , avoiding to   [low-code]
  maintain a separate back-end.
* Data is requested directly to users (vs provider's custom API).
