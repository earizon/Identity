## Internet Identity Workshop. Digital Credential API  [[{eIDAS,standars]]
significant progress on many core challenges faced by eIDAS wallet ecosystem.
* Agreements on integration of OpenID4VP within the Digital Credential API 
  aka Browser API:
  * Apple and Google presented a Demo/PoC together for cross-device flows
    using CTAP 2.2 Hybrid protocol. (Client to Authenticator Protocol). 
    This would finally enable secure cross-device presentation that has not
    been possible so far and it even could work cross-platform.
* Reworking of the OpenID4VCI Batch Credential Endpoint.
  * Great consensus on the further developments around the Credential Query and
    how to improve Presentation Exchange and integrating credential format 
    specific parameters 
* I initiated work with Mirko Mollik to evaluate and compare the 
  revocation and status mechanisms currently in discussion.
* OpenID Digital Credential Protocols(DCP) working group had a successful
  hybrid meeting on Friday, gaining consensus on many outstanding questions
  regarding OpenID4VCI and OpenID4VP Thanks to Google and Apple team for 
  participating and working together with us on these important topics

# Identity: German Wallet Architecture Concepts/proposals [[{eIDAS]]
* <https://gitlab.opencode.de/bmi/eudi-wallet/eidas-2.0-architekturkonzept>
(by Paul Bastian)
* Released second version of the architecture proposal for the EUDI wallet in 
  the German Consultation Process led by BMI and SPRIND - Bundesagentur für
  Sprunginnovationen.
* The updated version contains:
  * reorganized section for PID Options, adding two new HSM-based variations.
  * extended privacy and security considerations and applied them as evaluation criteria.
  * added new chapter on Operating Model.
  * added new sections on batch-issuance, revocation, wallet attestations.
* WARN: We are far from finished and important topics are still lie ahead of us.

## Lissi GmbH EUDI-Wallet Connector! [[{eIDAS.EUDIW]]
* <https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lissi_identity-authentication-eudiwallets-activity-7176525173691420672-tYAy> 

* Alternative 1. No connector: Each company implements the latest
  technical standards itself, which must be compatible with all
  EUDI-Wallets in the 27 member states, and which have to be updated
  regularly to meet the requirements of the Architecture Reference 
  Framework.
* Alternative 2: Use an "EUDI-Wallet Connector Software" with 
  common and stable API interfaces.

* WARN:
  *  Reply by Martin Kuppinger: "#EUDIWallets will speak special 
  protocols that are very complex."
  """ Fear, uncertainty and doubt never get old!Forgive my wallet
  pessimism, the is an inordinate amount of talent focused on 
  something that is very simple. All complexity feeds into the hands of 
  the super-aggregators, which shrinks the market and ultimately limits 
  diversity. 
  * Yann B. @IDAKTO: 
  """ I am curious to know where the 16+ months estimate comes from.
  In our programs some relying parties have needed only 48hrs to
  integrate the national digital ID.Yes it is only on credential and
  one protocol however we have to remember that the 
wallet aims to provide a lot of things but that the aim is for each 
relying party to get only the minimum it needs.There is still a lot 
to define on the #EUDI wallet but assuming that in the end it will 
require 16+months for a relying party to integrate the elements it 
needs is assuming that the EUDI wallet will fail

## Verified.Me (Fabric) [[{stack.fabric,blockchain,TODO]]
- Verified.Me, by SecureKey Technologies Inc., is the new and secure
  way to help you verify your identity, so you can quickly get access
  to the services and products you want online, in person and on the
  phone.

- Verifying your identity can be an inconvenient task. Waiting in
  long lineups to show several pieces of ID and answering multiple
  security questions are just a few of the hassles that come with
  verifying your identity to get access to the services and products
  you want.

- Verified.Me offers a secure and convenient way to help Canadians verify their identities.

- Verified.Me is a service offered by SecureKey Technologies Inc. The
  Verified.Me service was developed in cooperation with seven of
  Canada’s major financial institutions – BMO, CIBC, Desjardins,
  National Bank of Canada, RBC, Scotiabank and TD. The Verified.Me
  network continues to evolve, with plans of adding new identity
  providers and service providers to make your life easier.

## Microsoft u-Prove: [[{SSI,]]
* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-Prove>
* <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/u-prove/>

* Technology for user-centric identity management. The
  underlying cryptographic protocols were designed by Dr. Stefan Brands and
  further developed by Credentica and, subsequently, Microsoft.[1] U-Prove
  enables application developers to reconcile seemingly conflicting security
  and privacy objectives (including anonymity), and allows for digital identity
  claims to be efficiently tied to the use of tamper-resistant devices such as
  smart cards. Application areas of particular interest include cross-domain
  enterprise identity and access management, e-government SSO and data sharing,
  electronic health records, anonymous electronic voting, policy-based digital
  rights management, social networking data portability, and electronic payments.

## Decentralized PKI [[{]]
* 2015 paper describing DPKI, co-authored by  Vitalik Buterin(Ethereum),
  Christopher Allen (SSL 1.0), and Jon Callas (PGP and Silent Circle).

* Control over the identifier is returned to the principal [owner].
* No longer is it trivial for any one entity to undermine the security
  of the entire system or to compromise an identifier that is not theirs.
  This is how DPKI is able to address both the security and usability
  problems that plague DNS and PKI.

## AI + SSI [[{use_case.identity,w3c_did]]
* Leveraging AI to Create Value from Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)
  Hosted by the AI & Machine Learning Special Interest Group
  Wednesday, August 19, 11:00 AM -12:00 PM ET
  Thomas Behe and Neil Stansbury will discuss using A.I. intelligent
  agents in combination with real-time personal data updates and novel
  trust verification methods to leverage data insights for consensual
  marketing purposes.
  They will explore how using distributed graph technology can address
  blockchain scalability, cost, and speed limitations. Aspects of their
  approach include using one million graph vaults for one million
  customers \u2013 not one database or ledger block holding a million
  customer records.

  Highlights include:

  - Solving DLT privacy challenges for blockchain companies needing to
    securely store and manage personal data.
  - How identity sharing solutions can offer new consented-for
    marketing opportunities, while retaining personal privacy rights for
    citizens.
  - How persona-centric intelligent agents can work to benefit both
    citizens and businesses.

  Who-is-who:
  - Thomas Behe is the CEO, co-founder of Octopus.sh, a product
    innovator, entrepreneur, and published author of TJ's semi-fictional
    graphic novel that predicted society's serious data privacy issues we
    now see a decade after its publication. He has launched identity
    solutions for Experian, Barclays, Sky and iTV, his case studies
    taught at Harvard, Ivey, and Copenhagen business schools and has been
    published in Wired, HDVideoPro, and the FT.
  - Neil Stansbury is the co-founder and head of engineering at
    Octopus.sh. Originally trained as an aircraft engineer, he is a
    20-year software engineering veteran, having re-trained during the
    dot com boom. As an expert on web technologies, he built the first
    WebRTC video app for Google Chromecast and the original ITV Player
    (still the UK's 2nd most-watched TV app). His innovative
    VaultChain federated architecture addresses fundamental data
    ownership, socialization, and Personal privacy issues limiting
    blockchain technology.
