## W3C VC API

* <https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-api>
* WARN: It is NOT a W3C Standard nor is it on the W3C Standards Track. <br/>
  The specification is highly experimental and changing rapidly.
  Implementation in non-experimental systems is discouraged unless you
  are participating in the weekly meetings that coordinate activity 
  around this specification. 
* VC API Goals:  Define a set of RESTful API definitions conforming
  with the OpenAPI 3.0 Specification (formerly known as Swagger) for
  the roles of Issuer, Verifier, and Holder as described in the
  Verifiable Credential Data Model specification. 
* Test procedures and specifications are provided as part of this API
  definition to allow for repeatable and automated interoperability
  testing between solutions that interact with Verifiable Credentials.
