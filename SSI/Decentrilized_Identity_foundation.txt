# DIF Identity Foundation   
<https://identity.foundation/>
""Join us in developing the foundational components of an open,
  standards*based, decentralized identity ecosystem for people,
  organizations, apps, and devices."""

## DIF Focus:
* Technical Specifications
  Groups in DIF develop specifications and emerging standards for
  protocols, components, and data formats that implementers can execute
  against.

* Reference Implementations
  Beyond specifications, DIF members develop open source reference
  implementations of the technical components and protocols they create.

* Industry Coordination
  As the leading industry organization in the Decentralized
  Identity space, DIF seeks to align industry participants to advance
  their common interests


## Working Groups
* Identifiers and Discovery
    A key piece of the decentralized identity equation is how people,
  organizations, and devices can be identified and located without
  centralized systems of identifiers (e.g. email addresses). DIF
  members are actively working on protocols and implementations that
  enable creation, resolution, and discovery of decentralized
  identifiers and names across decentralized systems, like blockchains
  and distributed ledgers.

* Authentication
  Designing and implementing DID*based authentication specs,
  standards, and libraries used in authenticating DIDs across a wide
  variety of exchanges and use cases.


* Claims and Credentials
  The ability to verify the claims and assertions of identities is key
  in establishing trust among entities on a decentralized system that
  lacks a centralized hierarchy. DIF has recently begun work on
  defining the specs, protocols, and tools it can provide to the
  ecosystem to help ecosystem participants and their customers easily
  integrate DID*signed claims into their apps and services.

* DID Communication
  Produce one or more high*quality specs that embody a method
  (“DIDComm”) for secure, private and (where applicable)
  authenticated message*based communication, where trust is rooted in
  DIDs and depends on the messages themselves, not on the external
  properties of the transport(s) used.

* Sidetree Development and Operating Group
  The development and maintenance of the formal Sidetree specification,
  and a hub of coordination for Sidetree*based DID Method node
  operators. This group also generates libraries, tooling, and
  documentation to aid Sidetree*based DID Method node operators.

* Secure Data Storage
  Create one or more specifications to establish a foundational layer
  for secure data storage (including personal data), specifically data
  models for storage and transport, syntax, data at rest protection,
  CRUD API, access control, synchronization, and at least a minimum
  viable HTTP*based interface compatible with W3C DIDs/VCs.
